# ExpressNodeJS REST API Example

An example application demonstrating the implementation of a REST API. Most of the logic for the API Endpoints is located in the controllers. This feature branch handles invoice generation and emailing. View the API Documentation section of this readme (below) in order to view a sample request sent through Postman. As a result of the sent request, an email is sent to the email address in the JSON body of the request.
